# hello-world
First repository! Trying to figure out how this shit works

So apparently this is a committ? Taking me longer than usual to take information in because I am distracted by my parents doing their visa applications for their trip to Canada and Alaska; I am loling at the stupidity of the questions - "are you planning to engage in terrorist activity?" Shit, you got me. Guess I can't go to America after all...
